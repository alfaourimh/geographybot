# geographybot
A Discord bot that searches for a country through Wikipedia's API and outputs a summary


To create a bot in order to use the code, you can can create one here: https://discord.com/developers/applications

While creating the bot, you can configure it however you want, in this case. This bot doesn't need any additional permissions since it's just pulling from the wikipedia API

Once the bot is created, you are able to link it to a server of your choosing, the discord app will then notify you that the bot joined the server.

The bot will appear as online once you are running the python code.

NOTE: MAKE SURE TO REPLACE "TOKEN" IN THE LAST LINE OF THEN PYTHON FILE "client.run('TOKEN')" WITH THE TOKEN YOU GENERATE WITH YOUR BOT.

While runnning you can type "$search" to initiate a random search

For now this does random searches and is a work in progress.
